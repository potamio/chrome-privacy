    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Quick Tab Navigator is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be completely transparent about what information the extension handles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The extension accesses URLs and thumbnails of your open tabs to display them in the navigation grid.</li>
        <li>All data processing occurs locally in your browser.</li>
        <li>No personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li>User preferences (such as custom shortcuts) are stored locally using browser storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any settings or preferences you configure are stored locally in your browser using the built-in storage API. This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This extension does not use any third-party services or analytics tools.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data processing occurs locally within your browser and no data is transmitted externally, your information remains secure on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
